## Discoveries from Anaylsis
Set subsets to group by the sex of a given character. The analysis testing gave insight into the imbalance between male and female characters in comic books. 
Each year there are a new characters introduction, I found there was a significant difference between the introductions of new female and male characters.  I devided the data into new data frames of male and female characters. I sorted the new data frames by the character's created year. The average calculated of males was (and standard deviation) appearances of male and female characters. To my surprise, the overall average of male character appearances was 17 while the average female appearances 20. I concluded that the average appearance for male characters was less than female characters because Marvel Comics has a ratio of three male characters to every one female character. This ratio causes the male character appearance average to be brought down because the majority of the male marvel characters only have a handful of appearances. The appearance standard deviation of male characters was 105 while the appearance standard deviation of female characters was 82, as we can see from the standard deviations there was a larger spread between male character appearances and female character appearances.

### Introductions of new characters per year based on sex
The introduction of new characters per year based on sex. I had to first count the amount of male and female characters introduced each year then sort the data by year. After doing so I plotted the data so I could clearly see the difference between newly introduced male and female characters overtime. I will be using this new insight to develop a time series analysis to predict the number of new female characters introduced future on a yearly basis, using the observed values from FiveThirtyEight.
